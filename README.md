# Decentralized Will & Digital Inheritance System

## Project Description

A blockchain-based smart contract solution that enables secure digital asset inheritance planning. The system uses a "dead man's switch" mechanism where beneficiaries can claim their inheritance if the owner fails to check in within a specified time period. This eliminates the need for traditional legal intermediaries and ensures assets are transferred according to the owner's wishes in a transparent, automated manner.

## Project Vision

To solve the critical problem of lost cryptocurrency due to death or incapacitation of owners. We aim to democratize estate planning, eliminate intermediaries, and provide peace of mind to crypto holders by ensuring their digital assets are passed on to loved ones through secure, immutable smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Dead Man's Switch**: Automatic execution if owner doesn't check in within customizable inactivity period (minimum 30 days)
- **Percentage-Based Distribution**: Flexible allocation to multiple beneficiaries with precise percentage splits
- **Secure Fund Management**: All funds locked in smart contract until proper execution
- **Transparent Execution**: Blockchain-recorded transactions with full event logging
- **Trustless System**:
 No third-party custodians required, pure smart contract logic

## Future Scope

- Multi-signature verification for will execution
- NFT and ERC-20 token inheritance support
- Oracle integration with real-world death registries
- Conditional distributions based on age or milestones
- Multi-chain deployment for broader accessibility
- Legal framework integration for legally binding wills
- Mobile dApp and hardware wallet integration
